# Welcome to my Data & Artificial Intelligence Space

This repository gathers the projects I deemed relevant in my journey: analyses, pipelines, and experiments. Each folder corresponds to a documented project developed to consolidate my skills and explore real-world approaches applied to data.

I am naturally curious; I like to deeply understand the systems I use, and I value continuous learning. I strive to stay up to date with modern AI advancements, language models, and the tools transforming technical workflows today.

## What I Explore

I focus on three complementary areas:

### Data Science and Data Engineering
Understanding data, building clean pipelines, supervised modeling, rigorous evaluation, and implementing reproducible approaches.

### Advanced Automation
Using tools like n8n, Make, or Docker to create robust workflows, orchestrate systems, and automate entire processes.

### AI Agents & LLMs
Creating agents capable of executing complex tasks, interacting with APIs, automating entire business segments, or integrating retrieval mechanisms (RAG) to process information at scale.

These three pillars reinforce each other: analyze, automate, then industrialize with specialized AI.



## Tech Stack

| Domain | Technologies |
|--------|--------------|
| **Languages & Data** | Python, SQL |
| **Analysis & ML** | Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn |
| **Pipelines & Optimization** | Scikit-learn pipelines, GridSearchCV, cross-validation |
| **Big Data** | Spark, Hadoop (notebooks and university labs) |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| **Automation** | n8n, Make, APIs, Webhooks |
| **AI & Agents** | LLMs, RAG, multi-agent orchestration |
| **Environment** | Docker, Git, GitHub, Jupyter, Linux |



## My Approach

- Approach each project progressively: understand, structure, model, improve.
- Document my technical choices and compare possible solutions.
- Build clean, modular, and reproducible systems.
- Explore the limits of modern AI tools and integrate them into real-world workflows.
- Seek coherence rather than just accumulating models or scripts.
